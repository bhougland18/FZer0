== Introduction
=== Why use ZFS?

If you are here then I expect you to have at least a basic understanding of the benfeits that the Nixos operating system and the ZFS file system provide.
If not, then let me be the first one to tell you that you have reached the end of the internet and it is probably time you go to bed.
You are readin g about a system setup that probably only .000000001% of all computer users use, but they happen to the smart users and I plan to follow in their footsteps and leave a trail of breadcrumbs behind.

As for myself, I see many benefits of functional progamming and in general removing the amount of "inplace" changes, or mutation, in all levels of my technology stack. 
I have moved from using a traditional Linux system to Nixos, from Python to Clojure, plan to use a database like Datomic instead of traditional mutating DBs such as Postgres, and I see the filesystem as just another step in this evolution.

=== Why did I create this guide?

I am a beginner at ZFS, so I hope this guide doesn't have too many errors or omissions.
I have done my best to prevent any so included each and every step you will need to take to get this working.
I want it to be a hand holding guide for the beginner like me who has trouble following the Nixos guides because they assume too much pre-existing knowledge from the reader.
I used a combination of many guides in order to piece this one together, they are as follows:

https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_on_ZFS[Nixos Wiki on ZFS]

https://qfpl.io/posts/installing-nixos/[Nixos Installation without ZFS]

https://elvishjerricco.github.io/2018/12/06/encrypted-boot-on-zfs-with-nixos.html[Nixos with ZFS and LUKS]

Also, this guide is for me.  If I want to install this setup on another machine, then I don't want to have to research this information all over again.
So, I borrowed, and in many cases outright plagerized, the information in the links above in making my guide.
I hope the original authors don't mind too much :)

=== What Will You Get By Following This Guide?

WARNING: tis not done yet

== Partitioning the Disk and ZFS

=== Create Bootable Image

I mentioned that I will not make many assumptions of your knowledge level in this guide, but I will expect you to know how to make a bootable image on a usb drive.
In this guide I used the Minimal installtion CD image and Fedora Media Writer to create the image, but you can use other tools.

=== Prepare for USB Booting, editing boot menu
Now place the USB device in your computer and restart.
During the boot process press whatever key your computer requires, mine is F1, to get into the boot menu.
Once in the boot menu, ensure the following are selected:

* Boot order will use the usb device before the harddrive
* Disable safe boot
* UEFI mode is enabled

Now exit the boot menu.

=== Booting and getting a root shell

You will see a lot of activity with and terminal green colors, and when finished it will end with a simple green root Nixos prompt.
You are logged-in automatically as nixos. The nixos user account has an empty password so you can use sudo without a password.
[INFORMATION]
.The Nixos Prompt
====

[nixos@nixos:~]$
====
However, some command take the root shell, so type the following:
....
sudo -s
....
Now your prompt should be in red and end with a "#"

=== Setup Networking

WARNING: This section on WIFI did not work for me and I had to plug in an ethernet cable

Networking is necessary for the installer, since it will download lots of stuff (such as source tarballs or Nixpkgs channel binaries).
A wired connection is preferred, but I will use Wifi incase you don't have access to ethernet.
To make that happen do the following:

* Generate a minimal wpa_supplicant configuration. The $SSID and $PASSPHRASE are variables, enter your information.

....
wpa_passphrase $SSID $PASSPHRASE > /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
....
* Verify the configuration:
....
nano /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
....

[INFORMATION]
.wpa_supplicant.conf information
====
....
network={
ssid="MYSSID"
#psk="passphrase"
psk=59e0d07fa4c7741797a4e394f38a5c321e3bed51d54ad5fcbd3f84bc7415d73d
}
....
====
Great, now exit Nano kbd:[Ctrl + X]

* Restarts WPA Supplicant, which gives us WiFi for now
....
systemctl restart wpa_supplicant.service
....

=== Partitioning
Time to destroy some valuable data! Just kidding.
You won’t make a mistake, and more importantly, you have 3 copies of your data on at least 2 different types of storage media and in 2 different physical locations that are unlikely to be hit by the same disaster right? Right?!

WARNING: Jokes aside, *this process will wipe anything on the disk*.
Consider yourself warned.

This section will cover the following steps:

. How to create a blank partition table (delete current)
. Determine if you have BIOS or EFI
. Setup partition table based on findings in step above

We are going to use the linux program sgdisk to help us with this task.
More information can be found https://fedoramagazine.org/managing-partitions-with-sgdisk/[here].

==== Step 1: Delete existing partitions and start with a clean slate.

Identify the disk we are going to partition.  You will probably see two, one for the harddrive and the other for the USB drive.
The one you want will probably be something like *sda* or *nvme0n1*. The example below uses sda.

....
lsblk
....

Combine this with the prefix */dev/*

....
sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sda
....


==== Step 2: Determine if you have BIOS or EFI

A simple way to find out if you are running UEFI or BIOS is to look for a folder */sys/firmware/efi*.
The folder will be missing if your system is using BIOS.

....
ls /sys/firmware/efi/
....

==== Step 3: Setup Partitions

Okay, now we need to setup the partitions using the by-id aliases for devices, otherwise ZFS can choke on imports. https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_on_ZFS#Single-disk[*]

Issue this command to find the disk on your system.
We want to find Id of /dev/sda (or whatever your disk is):

....
ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/
....
[INFORMATION]
.Disk Information
====
....
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Jul 16 09:02 ata-HFS5124-33200d_F15110000d6930F35 -> ../../sda
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Jul 16 09:02 usb-3600050e02e433200d7110000d6930000 -> ../../sdb
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Jul 16 09:02 usb-3600050e02e433200d7110000d6930000-part1 -> ../../sda1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Jul 16 09:02 ubs-3600050e02e433200d7110000d6930000-part2 -> ../../sda2
....
====
We are going to have to reference this ID a lot in the next steps and I don't want to have to write it out a bunch of times or make a mistake, so lets put it in a variable.
This command is my attempt of using "commmandline-foo" to populate the variable "SDA_ID".
This regular expression identifies the beginning of the id (denoted by ^) then includes the drive prefix.
This works because I don't have any partitions yet.

[NOTE]
====
Remember to use your drive prefix here: ^[ata]
....
SDA_ID="$(ls /dev/disk/by-id/ | grep '^[ata]')"
....
====

Lets see if we got what we want (it should be a single value):
....
echo $SDA_ID
....

You should see the value of the sda drive from above.
Now we will combine the id with the device path and the /by-id/ flag:
....
DISK=/dev/disk/by-id/$SDA_ID
....

Just like when we created the blank partition table, we are going to use the linux program sgdisk to help us with this task.
More information can be found https://fedoramagazine.org/managing-partitions-with-sgdisk/[here].



[CAUTION]
====
 ZFS has issues using zvol as a swap device withing the zpool, so the instrustions below will create a dedicated swap partition.
====

Before you follow the steps below you should probably calculate the amount of space you are going to need for the swap partition.
My machine has 16GB of memory so I am going with 20GB.  In order to calculate your swap you can refer to this https://itsfoss.com/swap-size/[article].


===== Configuring EFI
Next, we are going to create the partitions in three seperate commands:
....
sgdisk -a1 -n2:34:2047 -t2:EF02 $DISK  //<1>

sgdisk -n3:1M:+512M -t3:EF00 $DISK //<2>

sgdisk -n1:0:0 -t1:BF01 $DISK //<3>
....
<1> Partition 2 will be the boot partition, needed for legacy (BIOS) boot
<2> If you need EFI support, make an EFI partition.
<3> Partition 1 will be the main ZFS partition, using up the remaining space on the drive.


===== Configuring BIOS

=== Configuring ZFS

WARNING: Do I need a swap partition here, see https://gist.github.com/dysinger/a0031aca70f9dc8df989010c88fc9c27


Below is the basic structure we will be creating.  Notice than the ZFS pools and datasets are all contained in SDA1.  We will have a home data set that we will snapshot and a nixos dataset that we will not snapshot as Nixos does a good job at keeping that information in sync and it isn't necessary to backup.

==== Create the ZFS Encrypted Pool
This is going to be a single disk on our laptop and it will use encryption, so issue this command:

....
zpool create -o ashift=12 -o altroot="/mnt" -O mountpoint=none -O encryption=aes-256-gcm -O keyformat=passphrase rpool $DISK-part1
....

It will then ask for you to create a passphrase:

....
Enter passphrase:
Re-enter passphrase:
....

==== Create the ZFS Data Sets

Issue the following three commands to create the data sets shown in in the diagram.
Note that the home pool will have automatic snapshots turned on.

....
zfs create -o mountpoint=none rpool/root
zfs create -o mountpoint=legacy rpool/root/nixos
zfs create -o mountpoint=legacy -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=true rpool/home
....

==== Mount the ZFS filesystems

We are only going to mount the filesystem, so we only issue these commands:

....
mount -t zfs rpool/root/nixos /mnt

mkdir /mnt/home
mount -t zfs rpool/home /mnt/home
....

Now we need to setup our boot EFI as a non-ZFS partition
....
mkfs.vfat $DISK-part3
mkdir /mnt/boot
mount $DISK-part3 /mnt/boot
....

Yea!! That part is over, now on to the fun part.

== Configuring Nixos before installation

In this section we are going to add the necessary entry to the Nixos configuration files to fully use the ZFS filesystems we created.
In addition, We will also add some software to make our initial login feel more like a useful, but still barebones, desktop environment.
At the expense of brevity, I am going to include the full configuration files so there is no ambiguity on what edits I am making and where.
I applogize to all those of you who are reading this on their smart watch.

=== Generate the NIXOS Config

....
nixos-generate-config  --root /mnt
....

This command will create two configuration files:

* hardware-configuration.nix - for hardware configuration
* configuration.nix - for software, etc

=== Get Networking Host ID

Before we start editing the configuration files, lets first get our machines networking host id, which is needed by ZFS.
The easiest way to get a value for this options is to run this command:

....
head -c 8 /etc/machine-id
....

Write down the shell output as we will need it in a moment.



=== Reviewing the Hardware Configuration

Lets open the hardware-configuration.nix file and see what we have.  Issue the following command:
....
nano /mnt/nixos/hardware=configuration.nix
....

[INFORMATION]
.hardware-configuration.nix information
====
....
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:

{
  imports =
    [ <nixpkgs/nixos/modules/installer/scan/not-detected.nix>
    ];

  boot.initrd.availableKernelModules = [ "xhci_pci" "ahci" "usb_storage" "sd_mod" "sdhci_pci" ];
  boot.initrd.kernelModules = [ ];
  boot.kernelModules = [ "kvm-intel" ];
  boot.extraModulePackages = [ ];

  fileSystems."/" =
    { device = "rpool/root/nixos";
      fsType = "zfs";
    };

  fileSystems."/home" =
    { device = "rpool/home";
      fsType = "zfs";
    };

  fileSystems."/boot" =
    { device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/3173-2880";
      fsType = "vfat";
    };

  swapDevices = [];

  nix.maxJobs = lib.mkDefault 4;
  powerManagement.cpuFreqGovernor = lib.mkDefault "powersave";
}
....
====

This looks good, so lets exit the Nano editor by pressing kbd:[Ctrl + X]


=== Edit the Nixos Configuration file for ZFS

Lets open the configuration.nix file and add the necessary ZFS information:
....
nano /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
....

Below is my configuration.nix file after making the edits.
Please review each of the callouts and add them to your file.

<1> Enable ZFS
<2> Prompt User for password to unencrypt root ZFS filesystem.

<4> Enable auto snapshots for the home folder, that was a parameter we set when we created it. I added the comment to let you know these entries were related to ZFS.
<5> Autoscrub will ...

Now save your edits in Nano by pressing  kbd:[Ctrl + O]

It will ask to if you want to change the filename, so just press kbd:[Enter]

=== Edit the Nixos Configuration file for basic usability

In the last section we edited the configuration.nix file for the entries needed for ZFS.
In this section we will make some additional edits that will give us a better initial experience when we actually install and start to use the system.
I spit the two sections so you would't be confused as to what edits were related to ZFS and which ones where just preference.

Okay, so you should still have Nano open to the configuration.nix file.  Lets make some additional edits, at the end your file should look like this:


....
# Edit this configuration file to define what should be installed on
# your system.  Help is available in the configuration.nix(5) man page
# and in the NixOS manual (accessible by running ‘nixos-help’).

}
....
It goes without saying that you will first need to uncomment these sections:

<1> update international setting and timezone, and update according to your preferences.
<2> Add packages that you want to use.  Make sure to include the mkpasswd because you will need it later. I didn't add much so you may want to go to https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html?channel=nixos-19.09[nix package search] and add more.
<3> Optional: enable lorri if you want to do any development on Nixos
<4> Enable pulse audio
<5> Optional: Add tlp power management service
<6> Enable flatpak for that software which isn't in the nixos repo.
<7> Enable X11
<8> Optional: Enable touchpad for laptop
<9> Set desktop environment to Gnome.  If you want KDE, then just uncomment that section.

If you see any other options above that you need enable, such as printing, please feel free to do so.
We will setup the user after installation so we can created a hashed password to put in the configuration file.

== Install and Additional Setup

Now lets test out the system
....
nixos-install
....
After it finishes installing, it will ask you for your root password, make sure you remember it!

Remove the USB drive and type:
....
reboot
....

=== Login and Setup User

The system will reboot then prompt you to provide your password to the ZFS encrypted pool "rpool".
Provide the password and the system will continue to the Gnome Login screen.  You don't have a user yet, so you will have to login as root.
....
username = type "root"
password = type the root password you entered in the nixos-install step
....

Now you should see a desktop environment, so lets setup a user.

=== Setup User

In order to setup a user we are going to need to provide a hashed password. So, issue this command:
....
mkpasswd -m sha-512
....

Copy the entire password, even it ends in a period.

Open the configuration file.  This time we will use vim because it can get access to the shell, which we will need for the hasshedPassword.
Remember, in order type you must first press btn:[i] and to exit edit mode press btn:[esc].
....
vim /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
....

Make it look like mine below, but change the user "ben" to whatever you want your username to be:

  # This value determines the NixOS release with which your system is to be
  # compatible, in order to avoid breaking some software such as database

}
....
<1> Users will be defined in  the configuration file only
<2> Change the username, in this case "ben"
<3> Add the user to groups.
<4> Type *hashedPassword = " "* (put your cursor between the quotations).
Next, type kbd:[esc] to exit Vim's insert mode, then kbd:[:] to bring up Vim's command area. Type the command:
....
    r! mkpasswd -m sha-512
....
Vim will prompt you to enter a password, so enter it and the string should appear around your cursor within the editor itself.
Make sure the hashed password is wrapped in quotes and the line ends with a semicolon.
A video demonstrating creating a hashed password can be found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imhkkctxr2A[here]

Now save the file by ensuring you are not in insert mode kbd:[esc], then press kbd:[:] and execute the following command (write and quit):
....
wq
....

Now you should be back at the terminal prompt.  Whenever you make a change to configuration.nix and it want it to be the default going forward, then issue this command:
....
nixos-rebuild switch
....

Now lets reboot and check it out:
....
reboot
....

Great!! At this point you have a system user.

== Closing Thoughts

We now should have a working Nixos system with a rocking ZFS file system.
I hope this guide helped you, and please let me know if any part was confusing so I can updated it to be more clear.
